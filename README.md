# 🏥 Healthcare CRM – SQL Project

This is a complete database project built during my internship at **SkilledUp**. The goal was to design and implement a **Healthcare Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system using **MySQL** that could handle real-world healthcare operations like patient tracking, appointments, billing, prescriptions, and more.
